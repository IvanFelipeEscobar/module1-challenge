# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this Repo is to practice applying semantic html in a webpage to help boost accesibility. Header, main and footer elements were added to help organize the html file. One id attribut was added to the html file to help fix a link in the nav bar. All image elements also had an alt tag added
In the CSS file several selectors were consolidated in order to avoid repetition.
Comments were added to both the css and html files identifying different elements
